Based on python language, a lot of work[1] can be refered to start my project. It has already been finished as a basic countdown program. But it might not be user-friendly one. Its drawbacks are listed as follows:
(1)It doesnot have a pretty GUI. The dialogue box is too small.
(2)The textbox is not set properly. No labels is used before or after that box.
(3)It might be useful to have a loop setting. [This is for my personal use.]
(4)I hope we shall have a time countdown rather than the number.
